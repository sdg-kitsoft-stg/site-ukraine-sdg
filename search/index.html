Particularly, these are poverty, inequality, climate change crises and violence. The participation and solidarity among all the countries and groups of stakeholders are extremely important.\n\nAccording to which the SDG indicators are data on platform given?\nIndicators of achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals for the period until 2030, approved by the Order of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated 29.11.2024 No. 1190-r “Some issues of ensuring the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in Ukraine”. This Order also determines the data managers responsible for their calculation and provision to the State Statistics Service, disaggregation and deadlines for submitting information to the State Statistics Service.\n\nBesides, archived data for the SDG indicators, in the context of which data was collected for monitoring the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, approved by the Order of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated 21.08.2019 No. 686-r “Issues of data collection for monitoring the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals”, which lost force on the basis of the Order of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated 29.11.2024 No. 1190-r “Some issues of ensuring the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in Ukraine”.\n\nHow often will the new data be added to this website?\nWe will add data as soon as they are received according to the dates specified by the Order of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated 29.11.2024 No. 1190-r “Some issues of ensuring the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in Ukraine” and verified.\n\nWhat disaggregations are available?\nThe disaggregation of indicators is presented in the Order of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated 29.11.2024 No. 1190-r “Some issues of ensuring the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in Ukraine”. In order to find out more about all data breakdowns and methodology, please have a look at metadata on the official website of the State Statistics Service “Sustainable Development Goals”: “Information support to the SDGs monitoring, metadata” https://stat.gov.ua/en/node/7503\n\nWhat browsers can I use to check out this website?\nOur website works with the most commonly used latest browsers versions. There could be some problems when using the website with old browsers versions.\n\nCan other countries copy data from this website?\nYes, one can copy data from the website both by every selected indicator and all the data available on the platform.\n\nBack to
